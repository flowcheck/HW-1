<p> Who Am I? I am Jack Mackinnon, I like skiing, I work at a summercamp, I have 2 dogs.
When I'm not skiing I like traveling too, road trips are the best.<br> I got super interested
in the IDP Program when a friend of mine really enjoyed it. I want to learn how to use
sublime and HTML. </p>

<p> Learning Illustrator is also really interesting. It's so cool what you can make, you can
just imagine it and create it. Such an awesome program, I'm really enjoying it. I tried to create
an account to collaborate with on github, but it got flagged and hidden.<br> Made a second one and that got
flagged as well. Couldn't find somebody to collaborate with. The Sublime program is great for coding however,
I really like how it autofills commands sometimes. Such as closing automatically. </p>

<p> Above are 4 of my favourite album covers, I like them because of the art and creativity that went into creating them.<br>
	It helps inspire me to create more. I really want to excel in this class and the course as a whole. I'm really enjoying the classes I am in.<br>
	Working from home is difficult as the FOL is confusing and organzing files on my own system is a relatively new thing. It's taking quite a bit of getting used to,<br>
	but I want to learn the content and am excited to see whats in store.
